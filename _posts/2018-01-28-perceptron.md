# Introduction

Developed a prototype mobile application for Great Western Railway's (GWR) maintenance division in partnership with the engineering team at Laira train depot in Plymouth to help digitalise and support their Just-In-Time (JIT) provision of tools and equipment for maintenance work on Intercity 125 trains. This project involved repeated requirement gathering, wireframing, heuristic evaluation and user testing before final prototype development within the academic time frame.

Working closely with Great Western Railway (GWR) on a Just-in-Time component and maintenance tool with an on-site team in Plymouth really challenged and motivated me. I believe that building a strong relationship with this customer was an important step towards developing a viable prototype product.

The JIT theory is based on the concept that an efficient flow of materials provides greater agility, responsiveness and reduced costs.

*“We got the idea of viewing the earlier process in a production line as a kind of store. The later process (customer) goes to the earlier process (supermarket) to acquire the needed parts (commodities) at the time and in the quantity needed. The earlier process immediately produces the quantity just taken (re-stocking the shelves)”* [14],[26].


Below is a brief discussion of the different steps of the project with particular notes of interest and comment.

## Usability

*“The extent to which a system, product or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use”* [65],[77],[84]

It is widely documented that "useable" software fulfils a range of qualities. This can be seen in Morville's honeycomb, a useful metric for evaluating a product.
