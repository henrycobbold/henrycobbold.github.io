# Introduction

To *Hayward* [1] the storyline behind Ingress, and a factor that represents one of the biggest difference between the applications, is that it offers a “a much deeper experience [than Pokémon Go]” [1] with the perpetual battle for “Exotic Matter” (XM) [2] across the globe. Pokémon Go is based on a narrative, but the main character(s) within show relatively little development as the a player progresses through the game [3]. Based instead on a user’s search for and collection of new and exotic Pokémon creatures, the game involves the mechanics of unlockable and evolutionary themes, making both typical of the adventure genre [4]. Mechanics should be “consistent, challenging and exciting” by providing stimulating feedback to a player’s interaction with the system with *Desurive*, *Caplan* and *Toth* [5] considering this tool a suitable heuristic with which to “evaluate [a games] playability” [5].

The use of AR engines involves users interacts with virtual objects, creatures (and structures) placed in the ‘real world’ [6],[7]. The interface here is not a typical one “that appears before you” [8], but more a “gateway that open up and allows passage to some place beyond” [8], albeit derived from our physical structures.

# User Experience

## Psychology and User Motivations

The motivations of the user is to interact with “monuments and other landmarks in the real world” [10] in order to collect as many of the vast number of Pokémon associated with the long-running franchise [3], as highlighted in section II., an element that has drawn in vast numbers of players.
The study of motivation is important as it allows developers to understand the central focal points of an environment and how these influence a user’s experiences and moods [11],[12]. Users will typically experience pleasure when their main motivations are fulfilled; such as completing ‘families’ of Pokémon by collecting, training or growing the creatures--comparable feelings to successfully hacking, or upgrading Portals. The motivations of status and affiliation are visible in both, but particularly central to Ingress and the global fight between the “Resistance” or “Enlightened” factions [9] for supremacy of “XM” [13].
Here a user’s status illustrates the power of their current abilities, or the rich collection of past experiences for which authority and peer respect can be gained [13]. In a 2015 study by *Winegarner* [9], 95% of Ingress players said they had never switched faction with most players clearly valuing loyalty and fulfilling the sense of duty to their cause. In Pokémon the process of successfully defeating friends at gym battles promotes feeling of achievement and power, rewarding users with in-game currency that can be used to buy a variety of upgrades and perks [10].

Players of both games are also showing more holistic affiliation with their enjoyment of the fantasy cartoon or fantasy sci-fi genres or a wider interest in Augmented Reality Games (ARGs [2]). One such player of Pokémon Go, in response to studies by *Paavilainen et. al* [10] described it as “a surprisingly social game” [Female, 31],[10] where “friends are playing too and we talk about new findings and level-ups and other advancements in WhatsApp. It is nice to share” [Female, 31],[10].

Users of Pokémon Go might also show signs of deeper affiliation, particularly love, towards the franchise or their Pokémon in which significant time has been invested in growing or catching the creatures to build a collection [14]. The motive of status is of particular note in Pokémon thanks to the sheer quantity and variety of Pokémon a player strives to collect; the rarest offering players an opportunity to stand out from others, a considerable status symbol in the game’s community. There are a range of other holistic incentives of playing AR-based location games that has helped fuel the uptake of both Ingress and Pokémon Go. The benefit of regular daily exercise and a healthy lifestyle balance is widely advocated [15],[16],[17]; so users might play the game out of a motivation to maintain haemostatis [13],[18],[19]. For certain Pokémon eggs to hatch up to 10 kilometres of walking is required [11],[20],[21] one such player, and one of the few to have completed the UK collection, lost two stone walking 225 kilometres “in a couple of weeks” [22].

Players feel a sense of accomplishment if they have achieved an objective that the game has set for them, a sense of which gained through continuous “self-talk” [12] that takes place during system interaction [12]. This could be on a relatively small scale within the context of the whole game, such as catching a certain Pokémon, or significant whereby a new level, badge or action is now available to the player. In order to participate in gym battles in Pokémon Go for example against fellow players a player must be at least level 5, if successful in battle a player can select the blue (or “Blanche” [23]), red (“Candela” [23]) or yellow (“Spark” [23]) team to pledge loyalty [20]. The act of unlocking level 5 gives a player a sense of achievement, and encouragement, that they are playing an intellectually stimulating game at which they can excel.

## Usability

Pokémon has enough buttons and controls with which all actions in the game can be performed, though they appear far less prominent than those throughout Ingress thanks to the design choices regarding colour, spatial orientation and separators the Nintendo franchise has consistently applied. The interface mechanisms and input channels in Ingress are, in places, unsuitable thanks to the nature of a typical device and the impact the environment has on successful interaction. A prime example of such design can be found in the control which limits the radii of the global chat feature. This slider, shown below, is inappropriate thanks to the level of touch precision it requires for suitable use. Accurate use of which is further complicated by the demands of the physical world (such as light levels and device orientation) in which players will typically be playing the game.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Ingress_slider_control.png" alt="linearly separable data">

User mistakes also apply to the physical world as users need to be aware of their physical surroundings [7],[10],[24]. Fig. 9. and Fig. 10. show safety notices for Pokémon Go and Ingress respectively reminding players to avoid distraction in unsafe environments [24],[25], a side-effect of total immersion or absorption, thanks in part to clear game incentives and precise interactions is described by *Csikszentmihaly* [26] as “being in the zone”. Players were also willing to put others in physical danger according to a study by *Wagner-Greene et. al* [21] who suggested of their study group “more than a quarter of players reported being likely or very likely to play the game while driving” [21].

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pokemon_LBS_warning.png" alt="linearly separable data">

The issue of instruction and learnability is one of the biggest differences between the two games. Pokémon, thanks to the limited instructions you receive when joining the game does not flood the player with game rules or scoring which could inadvertently confuse (and discourage) users; stifling the ability to learn. Pokémon Go restricts the features and content available to a player based on their level. This means players can concentrate on performing actions associated with reaching a certain level or performing a given action, as such the single-line directions are clear, concise and easily understood - as shown in Fig 11 whereby the Gym is not accessible until level 5.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pokemon_level_limit_notice.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Ingress provides similar information but does not limit a player’s actions based on their level. This means many features can be accessed but their actions cannot be performed. A more extensive “training mission”, Fig. 12., is included which is designed to guide players through the different actions, but the layout is overwhelming thanks to the quantity of on-screen content

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Ingress_player_training.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Other elements of Ingress too are complex, especially without instruction. Each portal can be clicked on to view its status and perform actions. However, thanks to the complexity of the game rules, and no formal instruction, the page is difficult for new or first-time players to comprehend, especially the process of linking portals. This can be seen below in Fig. 14. The lack of rules or instructions required the author to access the official online game manual in order to understand how games rules regarding Portal links actually works [27].

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Ingress_linking_portals.png" alt="linearly separable data">

The layout of the virtual environment on the screen in Pokémon Go is clear, helping players to successfully navigate the real world; a stark contrast to Ingress in which the virtual display of the “real” environment does not offer enough contrast to clearly navigate and despite providing strong theme continuity it is not as good a physical reference as Pokémon Go. The arrangement of Pokémon Go screen controls, believes the author, would make it clear for users to learn (after a short period of time) navigation within the app, making its use subconscious and instinctive.

## Genre Familiarity and User Perception

The almost overnight popularity of Pokémon Go is truly astonishing. As of 11th July 2016 Pokémon Go was the 5th most used Android mobile application in the US, the only apps more popular being the social media and messaging giants Facebook [Messenger], Instagram, Whatsapp and Snapchat with approximately 5.9% of all users interacting with the game [33]. During peak usage the number of Pokémon Go players exceeded those using the social media platform Twitter [32],[34]. On the same day, Pokémon Go was the most downloaded Android application in the US with around 10.8% of all platform users having installed the game [33]. For the developer monetary return is one way of viewing success with approximately, so it is of note approximately 80% of iOS users have made in-app purchases as of early 2018 [35]. Ingress too has seen significant in-app purchasing, a study of over 1500 players suggesting an average spend
of over $70 [36]--“3.3% of *Lui’s* online Ingress survey said they “have spent $1,000 or more” [36].

Games such as Ingress have not experienced the same worldwide popularity as Pokémon, after all few have... There have been indications that the popularity of Ingress however increased when Pokémon Go was released [50]. According to figures published by *Sensor Tower*, “downloads for Ingress [typically] hovered around 2,000 to 3,000 a day” [50] up until the release of Pokémon Go, but on the day of Pokémon’s release saw a figure roughly four times higher than this average, “16,000” or so [50]. In total, according to *Niantic’s 2016 statistical report* [37], Ingress has seen over 14 million downloads since its 2012 release.

The academic research and practical interest in tangible interfaces [38],[39], a field in which AR games sit, is on the rise. Applications that “give physical form to digital information” [39] support an amalgamated “Reality-Virtuality” concept that defines a combination as “Mixed Reality” (MR). This “continuum” model is presented by *Milgram et. al* [40].

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/RV_continuum.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Although LBS services are very much suited to smartphones and tablets thanks to their highly portable nature issues have been experienced with device power consumption where a combination of LBS and intense graphical provides considerable strain [10],[28]. One correspondent to a study by *Paavilainen et. al* [10] described Pokémon Go’s performance as:
“The app is a bit crappy. It freezes and lags quite a lot and the battery consumption is ludicrous” [Female, 25], [10]

Despite its increasing popularity however, various ethical and technological hurdles need evaluating. One such primary concern surrounding the process of “gamification” is that of player privacy [19],[19]. Issues have been voiced surrounding the collection of location-based information, particularly relevant for Pokémon where part of the playing audience is, outlined above, are children and young people [28], though this could be considered an issue with “social technologies in general” [29] and not restricted specifically to Ingress of Pokémon Go. In a parent’s guide to Pokémon Go published by the *‘UK National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’ (NSPCC)* [30] the lack of safety reminders and location privacy were highlighted as concerning, enforcing the moral motivator to protect children, or those vulnerable to exploitation [24]. The persuasive nature of such games, thanks in part to their unremitting “prompt[s] for attention” [31], can cover “questionable, unethical and potentially coercive” [31] behaviours.
