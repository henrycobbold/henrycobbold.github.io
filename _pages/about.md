Hello!

I would like to say thank you for taking the time to check out some of my work. I'm an Applied Computing graduate with a *First Class BSc Degree* in Applied Computing from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD), Swansea -- a top IT faculty in the UK.

I first discovered my interest in IT during my time at Exeter College two-years previous and have relished the opportunity to refine my skills in a broad range of IT subjects during my varied three-year degree. Throughout my degree however my passion for the subjects of Interaction Design, User Experience Design (UXD) and the broader subjects of Usability and Accessibility really drew me and I developed a real passion for the subject (and an even greater appreciation of the continual struggles associated with such a broad concept!)

Usability unsurprisingly featured heavily within my dissertation and I was incredibly lucky to partner my interest in UX with another passion--the railway industry in developing a maintenance support tool across the majority of my final years study. My high standards and unwavering efforts were noted and I was incredibly honoured to win the Universities *‘Development Project of the Year’* Award with a grade of 84% for the work. Awarded for my UX and software development-oriented Dissertation, a nine-month project that is presented to final year BSc students in the Faculty of Architecture, Computing and Engineering (FACE) across the STEM subjects. More on this piece of work, its timescales, outcomes and key components can be found in the Projects section of my portfolio.

Alongside University projects on my portfolio are pieces of academic research and papers written by myself. These two can be found in posts within the site and are available in full on request through my contact details.


Many Thanks,


Henry.
