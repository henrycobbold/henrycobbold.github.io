I would first like to take the opportunity to thank you for taking the time to look through some of my work as I have spent a good deal of time cherrypicking my professional IT work to date to produce this showcase - I therefor hope that you like what you see! I'm an Applied Computing graduate with a First Class BSc Degree in Applied Computing from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD), Swansea -- an award-winning top IT faculty in the Wales and the UK.

I first discovered my interest in IT during my time at Exeter College two-years three previous and have relished the opportunity to refine my skills in a broad range of IT subjects during my varied three-year university degree. Throughout this course however my passion for the subjects of Interaction Design, User Experience Design (UXD) was sparked and the broader subjects of Usability and Accessibility associated with this subject really drew me. I developed a real passion for the subject and an even greater appreciation of the continual struggles associated with such a such a broad concept as "system usability" and "design for all".

Unsurprisingly the themes of usability and user experience featured heavily within my third-year dissertation and I was incredibly lucky to partner my interest in UX with another passion, the railway industry. For my project I set out to develop a maintenance support tool that helps to manage component ordering, warehousing and allocation on site in a manner that aligns with the 'Just-in-Time' (JIT) production and resource allocation methodology. I was very lucky to be able to work with the scenario of a local train operating company (TOC) - Great Western Railway (GWR) to more accurately understand the issues of material ordering, storage and use for my mobile-based application.

My high standards and unwavering efforts were noted and I was incredibly honoured to win the Universities *‘Development Project of the Year’* Award for my nine-month piece of work, an accolade that is presented to final year BSc students in the Faculty of Architecture, Computing and Engineering (FACE) across the Universities STEM subjects.

More on this piece of work, its timescales, outcomes and key components can be found in the Projects section of my portfolio. Alongside University projects on my portfolio are pieces of academic research and papers written by myself, these too can be found in posts within the site and are available in full on request through my contact details.


Many thanks,


Henry.
